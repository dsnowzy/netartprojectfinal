      <h1 style=“color: red”> Virtual Reality </h1>
      <p> Technology has advanced thoroughly through the years, and our real life experiences have started to even become digital. With virtual reality, people have been able to reenact critical moments in sports history in their own living room if they wanted. It's become extremely common in golf nowadays, where wealthier families have installed netting and used virtual reality to play par 4's from their own homes at times. </p>
